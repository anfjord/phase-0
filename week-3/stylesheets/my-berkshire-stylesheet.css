#What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It's important that every html page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside a <link> element. The <link> element goes inside the <head> section.

#What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
It was difficult to position the elements the same way. We centered the elements we thought was obviously centered and we basically use a trial and error method to get it to look as much a like the original as possible.

#What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
We used css for colors (text,background,horizontal line) We used different fonts and sizes for different elements (the logo, the address, the bullet points etc).

#Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
Yes, we used classes and tried to avoid ids. We used classes in order to break out certain minor elements to style them eg the two first letters in the logo and the "inc" part.



#When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
I think my site is a cleaner beacuse I'm using an external CSS sheet and not inline CSS.
