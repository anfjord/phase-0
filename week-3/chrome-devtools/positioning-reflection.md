#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
It's a great tool for getting immediate response and see what changes in your css or html code looks like. It's also a easy interface to work with.  
#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements using the height and width element.

#What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute Position is use when we want to  us to position our element in an exact position.
Fixed Position  is when elements are fixed to a certain position and remains in that same place even when scrolling down the page.
Static Position is default setting for all elements. It is the position that element would have in the normal flow of the webpage.
Relative Position is calculated in comparison to where the element would be if it would have been positioned through a normal flow.
Static is easiest to understand, relative harder to understand how it will pan out.

#What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin is the space around an element, and can be used to move elements around the page to be closer or further away from each other. Border is the edge of the item. Padding is the space between the content of the item and the border.
#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?
  I'm not a huge fan of working in CSS (tedious). It was nice getting to know DevTools to make the work process more efficient.
