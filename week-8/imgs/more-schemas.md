#Reflection

It's a database  in which a record in one table can only refer to one unique record in another table.
This relationship between the two tables is unique


#When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
A one-to-one database is useful when both things are considered a pair - there is only one option for each


#What is a many-to-many relationship?
It is a database where any data from one table can have many connections with data from another table.  many different customers.

#What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
I love SQL. The keys is one thing you need to keep track of.
