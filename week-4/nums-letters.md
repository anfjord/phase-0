What does puts do?
The puts is short for "put string" and it is used to  display the results of your code. Puts also adds a newline after executing.

#What is an integer? What is a float?
Integer and float are classes. Intergers are numbers without decimal points and floats are numbers with decimal points	.


#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
With integer division your answer is going to be an interger for exampel: 9/5 = 1 With float division you will get a decimal for exampel: 9.0/5 = 1.8 (By adding .0 you will get a float division.)



Release 2:
#Hours in a year
def minutes
  60 * 24 * 365
end

p minutes

#Minutes in a decade:
def minutes
60 * 24 * 365 * 10
end
p minutes

#What is the difference between integers and floats?
Intergers are numbers without decimal points and floats are numbers with decimal points.

#What is the difference between integer and float division?
With integer division your answer is going to be an integer. For example 9/5 = 1 With float division you will get a decimal for example: 9.0/5 = 1.8 (By adding .0 you will get a float division.)

#What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings is a class in Ruby and is usually a bit of text you want to display.

#What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
A local variable is a variable that is given a local scope (scope is a term for the parts of your code that have access to a variable) Variables defined within a function are for example local variables.

#How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
Yes, it was a good review of the basics. It's been a number of weeks since I work with Ruby so this was a good run-down.
