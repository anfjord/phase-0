# psudocode:
# input: List of the students in my cohort
# output: List of accountability groups
# steps:
# Define the method
# Make a list of students
# Make a new array
# Select student from the list and make groups out of 4.
# Add the acc_group to the new array.
# Remove the students from the original list
# Do the same procedure until the original list is empty
# Return an array with all the acc_groups.

#Initial solution

#Reflection:
# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# The most difficult part was finding a method that didn't repeat!


# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# Absolutely, I still need to pseudo code a bit more thoroughly, I always understand more what is needed/missing when I see the code, that I should have thought of while psudocoding. That said, I am actually starting to return to my psudocode more for support.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
#I was very happy finding the while loop solution. I was  inspired by the GPS this week. Our guide gave us a few tips that was actually very useful in this exercise.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# I used an array

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# I did any refactoring this time (lack of time), but I'm always trying to look for cleaner built-in methods to use.
