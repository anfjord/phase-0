#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information Gathering
Planning
Design
Development
Testing and Delivery
Maintenance
#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary goal will be to present my background and my projects to potential employers in the tech buisness, with the goal to get an offer at a great company.

If I come up with a cool idea that would contribute to the tech community generally, I would
change the goal/purpose of the website. I actually think that employers rather see a website that contributes to the tech community. To know about me they could just go to linkedin.

But for now, presenting myself is the main focus. I'm ok with that.


#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
The target audience is future employers - that means HR-people, managers and developers> Since they are probably press for time the website need to be very concise. Also, I'm thinking that it they want to see something new, something thats sticking out from all other applicants. Hopefully I will come up with something as the course moves along.


#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action is probably to se my portfolio. If I build something cool I should really try to highlight it. After being superimpressed, I hope they would wanna look at my background information an finally look up my contact information and email me an invite to have coffee.


#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
User experience is how a person feels when interfacing with for example an app or a website. Knowing how to create a good user experience is important for many reasonson: in order to create accessibility, give user efficient and correct information, to gain customers and so on. Everybody doesn't respond the same way to the same website of course, but there are some well known rules or insights to how people react to certain designs, colors, types etc. Know about these preferences will help you create a website that strokes, at least the majority the same way, and hopefully your way.


#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

One, somewhat common definition is that UX design is the process of designing products that are useful, easy to use and delightful to interact wit. A successful UX design on the web is key and of great value whether you want to sell a product, inform people, or for any other reason you would want people to come and to return to your website or product. Without providing a delightful and easy experience it's very hard to reach out to others.


#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I didn't find any part to be tedious at all. This segment was interesting through and through.
