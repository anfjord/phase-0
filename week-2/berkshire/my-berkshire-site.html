  - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It's a great satisfaction to see what you learn come to life on a site. HTML is great in this way cause you can really see your progress visually - immediately.

  - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It went pretty smooth and it followed logic. There are some really good and well structured websites with syntax so the research was done pretty quickly. Also, it became  obvious that there are a lot of solutions/ways to creating the same website.

  - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
It was hard not to do formatting html. For sure. But the challenge where set up in a very smart way, and I understand the reasons behind it. That said,  I'm looking forward to learning about CSS next week.

  - What seems good and bad about HTML?
  A great thing about HTML is that you immediatly see the results of what you are doing and it's easy to change and to understand where the problem lies.

  - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
   You have to be very thorough with HTML. A very hands on thing that I do is to write both the starting and the closing tags at the same time so that I don't forget to close. I guess mostly it's about write a lot of code, and repeating over and over. It's also important to really understand what you write, othervise it will be much harder to remember.
