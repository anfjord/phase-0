#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Logg into Github. Click on the plus sign in top right hand corner. You will have the choice of creating a new repo. In order to clone the repository on to your computer, copy the url of the repo and find a good place to store on your computer. Use the command line and write "git clone" and then url that you have copied.

#Describe what open source means.
Open source in the computer world means a program that can be modified and shared (at no cost) because its design is  accessible to everyone.


#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I'm very excited about open source and the community around it. I think a lot of other areas/professions could be inspired by the open source community (eg. laywers, politicians). I think that there are certain programs that will be better to have as propriatery deeping on market, size and purpose of the project. Both open source and proprietary software are  here to stay. And the combination of open source project with  associated sales like wordpress, will probably be a succesful model. Open source is not utopia. Mozilla, android etc proves it. In order for these project to stay alive is that they stay relevant to a large number of people.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
A license grant a certain permissions for others to use your work. It's an efficient way to share your work and get help improving it. You don't have to grant individual premissions, but it protects your work and you as the original creator. There are many different licences depending on your project and how much you want to share.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
It was great to do the git/github commit/pulls several times. It made it easier to really understand the whole process. I got the concept early on, the explanations were great. The trick was to be thorough.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I liked the recommendation by a fellow student: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
Codacademy has also a short tutorial that is good.
